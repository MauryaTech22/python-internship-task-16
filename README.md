# Task 16 – Numerical Computing Using NumPy

## Objective
Understand numerical computing using NumPy.

## Concepts Covered
- 1D, 2D, 3D arrays
- Mathematical operations
- Broadcasting
- Statistical functions
- Random data generation
- Performance comparison (NumPy vs List)
- Vectorization

## Key Learning
NumPy is faster than Python lists because:
- It uses C implementation
- Uses contiguous memory
- Supports vectorized operations

## Conclusion
NumPy is essential for data science, machine learning, and scientific computing.
